## Overview

This QA Risk Dashboard was developed as a solution to prevent system integration failures like the "Payroll Meltdown" scenario inspired by UK Rail System and "The Phoenix Project." The dashboard helps validate systems integrations, track cross-team dependencies, and sends alerts before going live.

## Features

- **Run QA Check Button**: Simulates refreshing data from backend systems
- **CSV Upload**: Supports uploading task data with a defined format
- **Summary Statistics**: 
  - Clickable cards showing number of incomplete tasks
  - Clickable cards showing high-risk issues
  - Toggle filters to view specific task categories
- **Responsive Task Table**:
  - Department
  - Task name
  - Completion Status (✅/❌)
  - Risk Level (None, Medium, High — color-coded)
  - Notes
- **Alert System**: Shows Slack-style warnings for critical high-risk tasks with:
  - Expandable details
  - Team-specific suggestions
  - Comment capability for team communication
- **Interactive QA Checklist**: Organized by department for easy tracking
- **Filtering Capability**: Easily filter to view incomplete or high-risk tasks
- **Data Export**: Download filtered tasks, alerts, and checklists
- **Modern UI**: Clean, readable design with cards, badges, and simple fonts

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- Next.js
- CSS/Tailwind CSS
- JSON for mock data (easily replaceable with real API data)

## Usage

- Click "Run QA Check" to simulate refreshing the data
- Upload CSV files with the specified format to analyze new tasks
- Use the summary cards to filter for incomplete tasks or high-risk issues
- Review the table for detailed information on all tasks
- Check the alerts section for critical warnings
- Download filtered data, alerts, or checklists as needed

## Risk Assessment Logic

The dashboard analyzes task notes to automatically identify risk levels using keyword detection:

```javascript
// High risk keywords
const HIGH_RISK_KEYWORDS = ["assumed", "unverified", "outdated", "no one responded", "critical", "urgent", "failed"];

// Medium risk keywords
const MEDIUM_RISK_KEYWORDS = ["delayed", "pending", "waiting", "scheduled", "partial"];
```

Tasks containing high-risk keywords are flagged for immediate attention, while those with medium-risk keywords are highlighted for monitoring. This automated risk assessment helps teams quickly identify potential integration issues before deployment.
